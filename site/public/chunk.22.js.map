For example:\\n\\n          ```js\\n          import { props, withComponent } from \\'skatejs\\';\\n\\n          type Props = {\\n            name: string\\n          };\\n\\n          class MyComponent extends withComponent() {\\n            props: Props;\\n            static props = {\\n              name: props.string\\n            };\\n          }\\n          ```\\n\\n          The good news is, that you can reuse your Flow definitions and use the [`transform-skate-flow-props`](https://github.com/skatejs/babel-plugin-transform-skate-flow-props) Babel plugin to generate Skate props from them.\\n\\n          Your code would end up looking like:\\n\\n          ```js\\n          import { props, withComponent } from \\'skatejs\\';\\n\\n          type Props = {\\n            name: string\\n          };\\n\\n          class MyComponent extends withComponent() {\\n            props: Props;\\n          }\\n          ```\\n\\n          To learn more about how to do this, see the [documentation](https://github.com/skatejs/babel-plugin-transform-skate-flow-props) for the Babel plugin.\\n\\n          ### Sharing types between React and Skate\\n\\n          If you\\'re using the [React renderer](http://localhost:8080/renderers/with-react) to render your components, and you\\'re using Flow, you may find that you\\'re duplicating your props in your React component and your Skate component.\\n\\n          The good news is, that you can share these types, so long as the names and types are the same.
