## Committing

Ensure you have [commitizen](https://github.com/commitizen/cz-cli) installed and commit using `git cz` or `sk-commit`.

## Pull Requests

Pull requests should be issued for even the smallest change. Every pull request should have at least one corresponding issue.

## Releasing

Skate uses semantic-release and conentional-changelog so releases are published automatically.

## Notes

- Default branch should always be the latest stable branch.
